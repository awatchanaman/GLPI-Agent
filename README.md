# GLPI Agent

Agent allowing to communicate with a GLPI server.

It introduces new features and a new protocol to communicate directly with a GLPI server and its native inventory function.
Based on the FusionInventory agent (v2.6), it also supports communication with the FusionInventory plug-in for GLPI and will remain fully compatible in its 1.x versions.
